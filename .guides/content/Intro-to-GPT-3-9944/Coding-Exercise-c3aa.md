In this exercise, your task is to create a simplified collaborative tool using the ChatGPT API that can help a user get answers to their questions.

You need to write a function called `collaborative_chat_gpt()`. This function should take a single user message as an argument and return a response from the AI model. 

For simplicity, let's assume that the role of the AI model is always "You are a knowledgeable assistant."

Function Signature:
```python
def collaborative_chat_gpt(prompt: str) -> str:
    pass
```

**Example:**
```python
print(collaborative_chat_gpt("What is the capital of France?"))
# The output should be a response generated by the AI model based on the user message.
```

**Notes:**

Please handle the API responses carefully and consider all possible exceptions and errors.

Here is the solution to the simplified problem:

```python
import os
import openai
import secret

openai.api_key=secret.api_key

def collaborative_chat_gpt(prompt: str) -> str:
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a knowledgeable assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```
